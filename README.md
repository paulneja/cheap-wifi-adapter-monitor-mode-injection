Hello, GitHub Community! üëã

Are you looking for a WiFi adapter for pentesting, but all the recommended models are super expensive or hard to find?
I was in the same situation, almost buying a $200 adapter, until I found a generic one at home. I decided to give it a try‚Äîand to my surprise, it worked perfectly in monitor mode and supported packet injection!

Here‚Äôs my story and a step-by-step guide so you can try it too.

The Adapter

Brand: Generic (Realtek RTL8188FTV)

Model: 802.11b/g/n 1T1R 2.4G WLAN Adapter

USB ID: 0bda:f179

Tested on: Kali Linux 32 bits (latest version, recent kernel)

How to Check If Yours Will Work

1. Plug in your adapter and open a terminal:

lsusb

Look for something like:

Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188FTV 802.11b/g/n 1T1R 2.4G WLAN Adapter


2. Enable monitor mode:

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

If you see monitor mode enabled, you‚Äôre on the right track!


3. Test packet injection:

sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon

(Replace wlan0mon with your actual interface name if needed.)
If you see packets being injected‚Äîit works.

Driver & Firmware Installation

In my case, Kali did not detect it out of the box, but it worked perfectly after installing the firmware package:

sudo apt install firmware-realtek

No need to download or compile extra drivers.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
On some occasions, installing drivers or enabling monitor mode caused a kernel panic (your system may freeze or crash).

If this happens: just force reboot your laptop (hold the power button until it shuts down, then turn it back on).

After rebooting, everything usually works fine.

Is It Good for Real Pentesting?

Works great as a backup or for learning/testing.

Limited range and sensitivity, but excellent for nearby WiFi networks and basic pentesting.
